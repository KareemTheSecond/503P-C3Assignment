"The House of Candy" is a whimsical real-estate and confectionery company that transforms ordinary homes into fully edible candy houses using its signature “dip-dip” chocolate cauldron process. Customers can either sell their homes at market cost minus 15% for conversion and resale, or pay 51% of their home’s value to have it transformed and returned as a candy masterpiece. Founded by Kareem Hassani, the wizard behind the magic cauldron, the company combines real estate, art, and sweetness—offering buyers the chance to live in, sell, or even taste their dream candy home.
